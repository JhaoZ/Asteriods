# Asteriods

A mini-game of asteriods, where you control a ship moving through space that can shoot lasers at the incoming asteriods that threaten to break the ship. Collecting powerups can help you survive longer, as the game gets progressively harder each second that passes.

Requirements:
```
pygame
```
